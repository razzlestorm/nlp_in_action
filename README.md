## NLP In Action

[NLP In Action](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia) is a community-developed book on Natural Language Processing.
This repository catalogues my following along with the book, and will mainly be in Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Following Along

* The [NLPIA Github](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia) has excellent instructions for installing all of its requirements.
* Each chapter will be divided up into separate notebooks, with comments that closely mimic the annotations found in the book.

If you have any questions about NLP in general, please reach out!
Also, if you have any book suggestions, let me know! Most of my library is somewhat NLP-related, and I love finding new books about the topic, to better explain concepts that might initially seem confusing.
